1. Natural number
The number greater than 0, for example, 0, 1, 2, 3, etc...
2. Integer
Including natural numbers and numbers with a minus forward, for example, -1, -2.
3. Rational numbers
Numbers follow the format a/b, in which a and b are integers, b &#8800; 0
4. Irrational numbers
Numbers can not transform to the format a/b, where a and b are integers, b &#8800; 0.
5. Real numbers
Including rational numbers and irrational numbers
6. Power
We define a^b as "a is multiplied by themself b times", and read as (a raises to the power of b, or a power b)
a^b&#215;a^c = a^(b+c)
a^b/a^c = a^(b-c)
(a^b)^c = a^(b&#215;c)
a^n&#215;b^n = (ab)^n
a^n/b^n = (a/b)^n
Root: The nth root of a positive real number x is equivalent with x^(1/n) (n > 0)
